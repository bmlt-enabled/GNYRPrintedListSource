	<h2>NEW YORK REGIONAL PRINTED LISTS</h2>
	
	This set of files implements a PDF generator for six specific printed lists
	for the Greater New York Region, the Eastern New York Region, and several
	constituent ASCs.
	
	These have been ported over from some pretty old code, so don't look at them
	as any kind of sterling example. They are only useful to the New York area,
	and were developed in order to enable the BMLT to be used to replace the
	original meeting list database system already in place.
